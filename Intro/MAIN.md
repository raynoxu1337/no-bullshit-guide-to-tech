# How we got here
Technoloy IS tough, complex AND complicated. Anyone who says otherwise knows no better.
Getting started in world of technology can be daunting as it is hard to know where to start.
To make things a little bit more fun and understandable analogy with magic will be used in this wiki, let me explain why, If you don't care just skip to [What's a computer](../computer/MAIN.md).
Im my eyes technology IS magic, just way less sexy, although for layman's eyes it might aswell be magic. Think of it, we are always creating tech, exept that this computer tech is when it does seriously cross the physical domain and becomes some quite abstact thing. Bombs and guns are old-scool, raw battle magic, but these days we are using a little more complex and esoteric digital magic, it needs a lot more wizards and a lot more spells to work...
There are many wanna-be sorceres who fucking suck and there's alot of ultrachad wizards who want to make world a better place, by using their magic to make the wannabe's  get into magic a little easier, but IT IS magic and it was never supposed to be simple, so I will do my best to put my knowledge of magic into this wiki, as to provide you- an aspiring wizard with the ground up approach, from the magic silica stones and lightning bolts of electrons and build on top of it to the level you can create some spells yourself.
