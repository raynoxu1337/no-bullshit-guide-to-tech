# C# intro

C# is a mediocre language made by microsoft. It is cOmPiLeD into inermediate language, so it's basically like java, but it uses JIT to run shit from the IL representation. Performance is not too shit, there's .NET framework and IT IS possible to run already cOmPiLeD C# applications on windows linux, mac os, on linux for arm and all that jazz. You can use mono to do so.


## Writing code

You can use MonoDevelop, VisualStudio or something from JetBrains, they seem pretty ok.
