# C++
C++ is a multi-paradigm language. Originally C with classes, C++ is the gigachad language in a way that it goes fast as fuck booooi and has great expresiveness, BUT. With great power comes great responsibility and since it's really expressive, it allows for retards to express their shit ideas of code way too well, meaning codebases will be littered my unneccessay interfaces and random dumb abstactions that nobody asked for.
