# GIT tutorial

What the fuck is git? Well its version control, you dumbass. When ur a kid you just copy and paste folders when making changes just in case you fuck something up. Problems start if you want so share your multi versioned mAsTeRpIeCe of shit WITH YOUR BOIS! Git does exactly that, in the most uncomfortable and unintuitive way (the true linux way). Also in true linux retard way everything is named fucking wack so let's get up to speed with the terminology.

## Terminology

* Repo (Repository)- folder with git files set up. It can be local and/or remote (on the internet or lan or whatever)
* Pull - Download
* Push - Upload
* Stage - Choose shit that you want to save
* Commit - Actually save the shit that you chose
* Fecth - Sync your shit with the server so you can see if some retard uploaded something
* Sync - Scan local repo for changes so you can stage/commit them
