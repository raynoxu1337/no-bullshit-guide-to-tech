## What is a computer, really?
I would say the normal consesus on what a computer is, is defined by Alan Turing, called a [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), but that's a little too abstract to be useful in reality.
More realistic model is proposed by Von Neumann (Yeah the same physics bro) and is called [Von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture).
